= Anki 2.1 Beta =

== Translations ==

 * на русском языке: http://finpapa.ucoz.ru/ankitest-beta.html

== At a glance ==

- Uses the same scheduling, syncing and file format as Anki 2.0.x, so you can upgrade and downgrade at will.
- Upgraded to the latest support libraries (Python 3, Qt 5.9), bringing fixes for crashes, better handling of high resolution displays, non-Latin text, and the latest web standards.
- Requires a modern system - Windows 7+, OSX 10.10+, or a Linux distro from around 2014+.
- Add-ons will need to be updated to work with 2.1.

== Stability ==

You can be fairly confident the beta will not eat your data. 2.1 has been in
alpha status for the last year as we waited for toolkit issues to be resolved,
and we have not had any reports of data loss during that time. It's still a
good idea to make backups however - please use File>Export to export 'all
decks' with scheduling and media included before you upgrade, and consider
doing it periodically after upgrading as well.

== Add-ons ==

Most add-ons will need to be updated before they'll work with Anki 2.1. When
you install 2.1, it will create a separate folder for add-ons, and not import
any existing ones you have installed.

If you're an add-on author, you can read more about the required changes on
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons21.html

== Video drivers ==

If you run into crashes or black screens, your video drivers may be to blame.
On Linux, please try start the beta with the following:

    QT_OPENGL=software bin/anki

On Windows, please try opening cmd.exe, and typing the following

    cd ""\program files (x86)\anki"
    set QT_OPENGL=angle bin/anki
    anki

If that doesn't help, replace 'angle' with 'software' and try again.

== Problems ==

If you run into any issues, please let us know on the beta testing section of
our support site:

https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/beta-testing

== Downloads ==

You can get the latest beta from https://apps.ankiweb.net/downloads/beta/

Use .exe for Windows, .dmg for Mac, and .bz2 for Linux.

== Detailed changes ==

=== Changes in beta 16 ===

MathJax display environments now need to start with `\[` and end with `\\]`,
instead of using `$$`. Shortcut keys have been added to the editor to make
using these easier, but existing MathJax cards will need to be updated
unfortunately.

Backups and collection exports now use a separate .colpkg file extension,
which allows translating of their titles and allow multiple collection exports
to be stored in one folder. The other clients will be updated to understand
these extensions in the future; for now if you need to interact with them, you
can rename the file.

Also:

- Fixed backups not being made correctly on some systems.
- Fixed old backups not expiring. Anki will only look for .colpkg files now,
so you will need to manually remove your old .apkg backups.
- Collection exporting and saving graphs to PDF now lets you choose the target
folder, and the default folder is now the documents folder instead of the
desktop.
- Fix the preferences screen loading slowly, opening multiple times, and not
closing when the collection is closed.
- Fix preview window not closing on collection close.
- Fix inability to preview the answer of the last card.
- Cloze deletions should now properly remove highlighting only when in a
MathJax environment.
- Add-ons now have a persistent user_files folder - please see the add-on docs.
- Tweak margins in deck options.
- Fix searches for decks with parens in the name.
- Fix Anki interface displaying incorrectly when Windows has an incorrect mime
type for css files.
- Tweaks to the text displayed when an error occurs.
- The "oldest seen first" option in filtered decks now sorts based on last
review instead of card modification time.
- The prepareQuestion/prepareAnswer hooks have been merged into prepareQA -
please see the add-on docs.
- Don't force audio format on Windows - please let me know if you encounter
regressions playing audio.
- Clicking on a note type in the browser now searches with the name instead of
the note type ID.
- Refuse to run when locale configured incorrectly on Linux.
- Fix remaining issues with formatting being lost when cutting and copying
between fields.
- Remove the trailing `<br>` when saving a field.
- Fixed translations in dialog buttons.

=== Changes in beta 15 ===

- Look for changed media files when syncing, even if no files have been added
or removed. If you have many media files and notice a slowdown when syncing,
please let me know.
- A fix for the UI sometimes loading improperly.
- Various improvements to the tag completion area (thanks to Glutanimate).
- Hotkey for "show both sides" in preview window (thanks to Glutanimate).
- Fix margins in preferences screen.
- Some fixes for the add-on configuration code.
- Don't strip formatting when pasting from one field in Anki to another.
- Check Media now catches invalid filenames on Linux systems.
- Fix toggling of suspend etc when multiple cards selected.

=== Changes in beta 14 ===

Added a simple configuration mechanism for add-ons, intended for use when
users would have previously had to edit an add-on's source code. Configuration
is not lost when add-ons are updated. For more info, please see
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons21.html#configuration

Also:

- Option for showing both sides in preview screen.
- When a user starts Anki 2.1 for the first time, it will now import the profile data from Anki 2.0.
- Add JS hooks to the reviewer for doing things like automatic scrolling at the right time:
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons21.html#javascript-in-the-reviewer
- Fix scrollbar appearing at certain DPI scales.
- Fix 'clear flag' shortcut.
- Add 'collection' and 'current deck' to the sidebar.
- Add recording icon back to record window.
- Warn about subfolders in media check.


=== Changes in beta 13 ===

Add-on authors can now upload separate files to AnkiWeb for 2.0 and 2.1
support, and Anki 2.1 will automatically list and download the 2.1 versions.

The add-on menu has been moved into a separate dialog, which supports:

- checking for and downloading updates
- deleting and disabling multiple add-ons at once
- viewing an add-on's page

Add-ons are now always stored in a single folder, and need to be uploaded as a
.zip - please see the updated docs for more information:

https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons21.html#add-on-folders
https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/addons21.html#sharing-add-ons

=== Changes in beta 12 ===

Fixes an issue that could allow a specially crafted .apkg file to write files
outside the media folder during import. AnkiWeb shared decks were not
affected, but upgrading is strongly recommended if you import .apkg files from
third party sources. A big thanks to David Bailey for discovering this issue.
2.0.47 is also available with this fix.

Also:

* Rewrote parts of the collection opening/closing code and window closing
code, which should ensure the collection isn't closed until windows have a
chance to clean up.
* The profile manager now has a button to restore a profile to an automatic
backup, which will take care of clearing out a corrupt collection and make
sure backups are not rotated when restoring.
* Added an optional sidebar to the browse screen; toggle via the Filter button.
* Icon tweaks.
* Ctrl+1-9 can be used to jump to the first 9 card templates in the card layout screen.
* Add a default note type for typing in the answer.
* Backups now include the date in the filename.
* Backups are sent to the trash instead of being deleted outright.
* Fix decks being moved to the default deck when dragged to the bottom (thanks
to David Bailey)
* Fixed some issues with field contents being updated with the wrong content.
* Better support for DPI scales that are not multiples of 100% on Windows.
* The Filter button now uses more obvious titles when splitting menus into
submenus, and will split the decks and note type lists if necessary as well.
* Tweak some shortcuts.
* Better error when internet offline.
* Drop support for profile passwords.
* Fix shift+tab in the editor on Windows/Linux.
* Restored support for the marked tag.

=== Changes in beta 11 ===

- Simplify the browser window:

- Remove 'mark' action in favour of 'flags':
** Flags are set on individual cards rather than the whole note.

the answer side.
- Delays can be customized via the qFade/aFade variables in Javascript - set
to 0 to disable.

the preview more efficiently.
- The card layout and preview window in the browser now render cards the same
way as the review screen.
- Fix a bug that was preventing Anki from shutting down properly on Windows.
- Fix a bug that was causing images not to show if the media server port was

- Support make install/uninstall on Linux.
- Make the down key do the right thing when browser window opened.
- Make it easier for add-ons to override shortcuts for a specific state.

=== Changes in beta 8 ===

Experiment with showing the question below the answer, which makes the fade

- Added a transition when revealing the answer - necessary now that we're not
preloading the answer.

=== Changes in beta 6 ===

Linux users: there are two Linux builds for this release. The "normal" build
should now work on Ubuntu 14.04 and similar distributions, and should be fine
for more modern distributions too. If you encounter a problem with the normal
build, please try the alternate one, and let us know that the normal one is
not working for you.

Other changes:

- Add a fade out/fade in transition between cards when reviewing, which
minimises pop-in for cards using images and MathJax.

they are rendered after the card is shown. The next AnkiMobile beta will
support MathJax; the other clients will need to be updated.

-----
\(\sqrt{x^2}\)

$$x_3$$
-----

- LaTeX can now be rendered as a .svg file instead of a .png file, which can
be scaled to arbitrary sizes without losing quality. You'll need to have
dvisvgm installed, and can then enable it via Tools>Manage Note Types>Options.
The next AnkiMobile beta will support .svgs; the other clients will need to be
updated.
- Fix IBus input method not working on Linux.
- Fix superscript shortcut key.
- Both reviewer and browser use ctrl+delete as shortcut for deleting the
current/selected card now.
- Fix crash when syncing on Windows.
- Improve display of cloze and LaTeX tags when field is in RTL mode.
- Work around ampersands appearing in deck names when running in KDE.

=== Changes in beta 4 ===

- yet more fixes for Anki failing to start on some Linux distros
- fixed errors that could happen when add-on authors wrapped an Anki function (thanks to dequis)
- make it easier for add-ons to extend bottom buttons (thanks to Dmitry)
- don't load iframe content in a separate browser window
- remove the change in beta 3 that was leading to lots of non-breaking spaces in pasted text

This beta also introduces experimental support for alternative whitespace
handling. When enabled for a note type via Tools>Manage Note Types>Options,
the editor and reviewer will wrap your HTML content in a pre-wrap whitespace
environment. What this means is that instead of using <div> and &amp;nbsp;
tags/entities to denote newlines and indents, normal newline and space
characters will be used. Things to note:

- This is experimental at the moment, and may go away if major issues are
discovered. For now, please consider it something to play around with rather
than something to rely on.

- The mobile clients do not currently support the option, though you may be
able to get cards to display the same way when reviewing on mobile by adding
white-space: pre-wrap to your card styling in your template.

- When pasting HTML into a field, Anki will try to convert the divs and
non-breaking spaces to more readable whitespace equivalents.

- Existing notes may display differently with the option enabled, because
whitespace is now respected. For example, the following on a card template:

-----
{{Front}}<br>
{{Extra}}
-----

will include two newlines between the fields, because of the newline after the
BR. To get the card to display as before, remove the <br> tag.

If your note contain manually edited HTML or HTML pasted from other websites,
they may also show differently because of the whitespace inside them.

Any feedback on what works and what does not would be appreciated.
